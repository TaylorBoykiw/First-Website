<p> Im Taylor Boykiw and I love biology. Im always inspired to learn more and more about it everday because she knows how 
little people know. Presently, I have over 20 plants in her room alone, while also supporting multiple generations of stick bugs.
 She names her stick bugs' generations after famous singers, for example, the Nov 2019-x generation is called the bowie generation. </p>

<p> I really enjoy going out for long rainy runs in the forest. It's exciting and thrilling with always something new to notice(which additionaly helps with noticing certain ecological niches). I work for UBC's bptany department and and may start helping them out more in the future. </p>
